However, there is no way to know in advance the optimal values for each hyper-parameter. The process of choosing optimal hyper-parameters involves comparing the decision metrics of models with a different hyper-parameter (or combination of hyper-parameters). [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) is a form of Scikit-Learn function which iterates through an exhaustive grid of hyper-parameter combinations, trains a model using those parameters, and then selects the best hyper-parameter combination based on a scoring function.\n","\n","The function signature of the GridSearchCV is: `GridSearchCV(estimator, param_grid, scoring, refit, cv)`\n","\n","The first argument, `estimator`, is a regressor or classifier model such as sklearn.svm.SVC())\n","\n","The `param_grid` is the hyper-parameter space in the form of a Python dictionary. A basic param_grid for an SVC estimator looks like this:    \n","  `param_grid =  {'C': [1, 10, 100, 1000], 'gamma': [0.001, 0.0001], 'kernel': ['rbf']}`   \n","A grid search run with this parameter grid will test 8 models (4 $C$ parameters * 2 gamma parameters * 1 kernel parameter)\n","<table>\n","\t\t<thead>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<th>Model #<br></th>\n","\t\t\t\t<th>C</th>\n","\t\t\t\t<th>gamma</th>\n","\t\t\t\t<th>kernel</th>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t</thead>\n","\t\t<tbody>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0<br></td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>1<br></td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.001</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf</td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.0001</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf <br></td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>10</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.001 <br></td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf</td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>10</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.0001 <br></td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf</td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>100</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.001</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf</td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>100</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.0001</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf</td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>1000</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.001</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf</td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t\t<tr>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>7</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>1000</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>0.0001</td>\n","\t\t\t\t<td>rbf</td>\n","\t\t\t</tr>\n","\t\t</tbody>\n","\t</table>\n","\n","\n","The `scoring` argument provides the metric(s) by which the model will be compared.
